- TODO:
  - +Level to weapon damage rolls?
  - HP includes Vitality modifier per Level? Or Vitality score per Tier? Or Vitality modifier per Tier?
  - Gunslinger is fighter subclass?
  - Are there subclasses? Subclass is instead of exploits at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16?
  - Or is subclass extra an unnecessary complexity? I like the idea of picking at least one continuous thematic thing and it enables out-of-class features.

Fighting for honor, greed, loyalty, or simply the thrill of battle, you are an undisputed master of weaponry and combat techniques. You combine your actions through clever combinations of opening moves, finishing strikes, and counterattacks whenever your foes are unwise enough to drop their guard. Whether you are a knight, mercenary, sharpshooter, or blade master, you have honed your martial skills into an art form and perform devastating critical attacks on your enemies.
