Most commoners are level 1. A soldier who has seen combat is level 2. A veteran of war is probably level 4. A lesser noble is level 4-8. A king is level 8-10. The levels beyond 10 are exceedingly rare, especially for mortals. A ruler whether noble or king cannot be, certainly could not remain first level, as they are not worth following without the strength to lead. Middle-earth (Mercury?) is a brutal place. Bureaucrats or weak men will be replaced with those who have the strength to deal with the evil in the world.
