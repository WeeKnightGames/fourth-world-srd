If you are trained in a skill, add your Tier to all relevant rolls.

Unlike other similar games, Fourth World has no Perception skill. When looking for something, either rule as the GM or have the PC roll make a Discernment check with the most relevant skill modifying it. For example, checking for a ambush could be modified by Combat or Survival, checking for a trap might be Thievery, checing to see if someone was lying would be Deception, etc.

How to combine? so we have fewer?

**Athletics (includes Acrobatics?)**
: Your Might+Athletics check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Your Agility+Athletics check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck.

**Arcana (maybe?)**
: Your Cognition+Arcana check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes. You also use Arcana to make Arcane Spell attack rolls.

**Combat**
: Your Might+Combat check involves making melee weapon and unarmed attack. Your Agility+Combat check involves making ranged weapon attacks.

**Creation (instead of Nature, Wilds, Chaos, opposite of Society?)**
:  Your Cognition+Creation check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles. You also use Creation to make Primal Evocation attack rolls.

**Deception**
: Your Presence+Deception check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

**Diplomacy/Persuasion**
: When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Presence+Persuasion check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

**Engineering**
: Your Agility+Engineering or Cognition+Engineering check can be used to create, understand, and repair primitive and technological items, buildings, and other constructions.

**Intimidation**
: When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Presence+Intimidation check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

**Medicine**
: A Discernment+Medicine check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

**Performance**
: Your Presence+Performance check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

**Religion**
: Your Cognition+Religion check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults. You also use Religion to make Divine Prayer attack rolls.

**Society**
: Your Cognition+Society check can help you understand the people and systems that make civilization run, and you know the historical events that make societies what they are today. Further, you can use that knowledge to navigate the complex physical, societal, and economic workings of settlements. Your Cognition+History check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

**Stealth**
: Make a Agility+Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

**Survival**
: The GM might ask you to make a Discernment+Survival check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

**Thievery**
Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Agility+Thievery check. The GM might also call for a Agility+Thievery check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.
