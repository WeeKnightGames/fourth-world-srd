- TODO:
  - Any martial variants?
  - +Level to spell damage rolls?
  - Domain like fighter subclass at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16? Or 1 bonus per tier at 1, 6, 11, 16? Does it grant extra prayers? Extra Bond? Some of the domains make sense to grant non-divine prayers but what about ones that mostly/only give divine prayers?
  - Do prayers have "levels" or just tiers?

**Features**

  - *Bond.* You gain 3 (2 + Tier) Bond that you can use to call on your deity through divine prayers. Any spent Bond refresh after a long rest.
  - *Divine Prayers.* You gain [Divine Prayers](#powers-divine-prayers) as you level to gain new powers or to upgrade existing ones. Instead of gaining a new Divine Prayer or upgrading an existing one, you may pick a General Feat, or you may upgrade a power granted to you by your domain even if it is not a Divine Prayer.
  - *Domain* You select a domain aligned with your deity's that grants additional class features at levels 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16. You may spend Bond instead of Mana or Blood for powers granted by your domain. If you already have some domain feature, replace it with an equivalent, DM-approved power or upgrade.
  - *Divine Insight* You make divine prayer attack rolls with Discernment?
