Maybe way fewer feats? But if fewer then why all the levels? Are exploits and their upgrades both just feats? Like PF2e.
Bonus damage? Bonus dice? +Level to weapon damage rolls? Shock?
HP includes Vitality modifier per Level? Or Vitality score per Tier.
Fighter gets only Exploits but can trade an Exploit for a Feat?
How do features interact with the rest of it all?
