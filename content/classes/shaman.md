While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These primal adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the influence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.

Shamans make for potent primal spellcasters, capable of using primal spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren't the healers that clerics are, they can fill that role when needed.

  - *Spirit of Battle (Primal Companion Spirit).* A shaman who selects the spirit of battle gains scars from every wound she takes, and the grit of battle always seems to cling to her body. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, she grows in stature---becoming taller and more muscular, with a grimace of rage stretching across her face.


  - *Spirit of the Heavens (Primal Companion Spirit).* A shaman who selects the spirit of the heavens has eyes that sparkle like starlight, giving her an aura of otherworldliness. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, her eyes turn pitch black and the colors around her drain for a brief moment.
