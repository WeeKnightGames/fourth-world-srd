- TODO:
  - Do upgrades replace what they upgrade or add on?
  - To what extent should upgraded spells just replace earlier ones?

**Firebolt**
: As an action, spend Blood, an enemy within 100' makes an Evasion save (or you make a ranged spell attack). On a failure (or a hit), target takes 2d6 thermal damage per Tier. On a success (or a miss), half damage.
  - Upgrades:
    **Scorching Ray**
    : As an action, spend Blood, two enemies within 100' make an Evasion save (or you make a ranged spell attack). On a failure (or a hit), target takes 3d6 thermal damage per Tier. On a success (or a miss), half damage.

    **Fireball** Requires: Tier 2
    : *A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.* <br/>As an action, spend Blood, each creature in 20'-radius sphere within 100' makes an Evasion save. On a failure, target takes 4d6 thermal damage per Tier. On a success, half damage.

    **Inferno** Requires: Tier 3
    : As an action, spend Blood, each creature in 25'-radius sphere within 200' makes an Evasion save. On a failure, target takes 5d6 thermal damage per Tier. On a success, half damage.

    **Cataclysm** Requires: Tier 4
    : As an action, spend Blood, select four 50'-radius spheres within a mile. Each creature therein makes an Evasion save. On a failure, target takes 6d6 thermal damage per Tier. On a success, half damage.

**Ignite**
: As an action, spend Blood, a weapon you can touch blossoms into flame. While sustained, hits with the weapon deal an additional d6 thermal damage (per Tier). Alternatively, an item you touch bursts into flame. While sustained, the fire is almost impossible to put out and quickly consumes the item and whatever it touches.
  - Upgrades:
    **Quick Cast**
    : You may cast this spell once on your turn instead of spending an action.

    **Extend**
    : You may target a weapon or item you can see within 30' rather than one you can touch.
