If you are trained in a skill, add your Tier to all relevant rolls.

Skill check = 2d10 + ability score modifier + Tier if trained in relevant skill + item bonuses + etc.

Or ability check (modified by a skill)?

Unlike other similar games, Fourth World has no Perception skill. When looking for something, either rule as the GM or have the PC make a Discernment check with the most relevant skill modifying it. For example, checking for an ambush could be modified by Combat or Survival, checking for a trap might be Thievery, checing to see if someone was lying would be Deception, etc.

Group checks - Everyone rolls. Success covers 1 failure. Critical covers 2 failures or 1 botch. Two successes are requires to cover 1 botch. If any failures/botches weren't covered, the group fails; otherwise the group succeeds.

Leader checks - A variant take on group checks. But the leader's check is used as the result?

Chivalry instead of Civilization or Persuasion or Performance?

**Athletics**
: Your Might+Athletics check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Your Agility+Athletics check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck.

**Civilization**
: Your Cognition+Civilization check can help you understand the people and systems that make civilization run, and you know the historical events that make societies what they are today. Further, you can use that knowledge to navigate the complex physical, societal, and economic workings of settlements. Your Cognition+Civilization check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

**Combat**
: Your Might+Combat check involves making melee weapon and unarmed attack. Your Agility+Combat check involves making ranged weapon attacks.

**Deception**
: Your Presence+Deception check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

**Engineering**
: Your Cognition+Engineering check can be used to understand primitive and technological items, buildings, and other constructions. Your Agility+Engineering check can be used to create or repair such items.

**Intimidation**
: When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Presence+Intimidation check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

**Performance**
: Your Presence+Performance check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

**Persuasion**
: When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Presence+Persuasion check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

**Religion**
: Your Cognition+Religion check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults. A Discernment+Religion check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion, diagnose an illness, or attempt to heal body and spirit. You also use Religion to make Divine Prayer attack rolls.

**Spellcraft**
: Your Cognition+Arcana check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes. You also use Arcana to make Arcane Spell attack rolls.

**Stealth**
: Make a Agility+Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

**Survival**
: The GM might ask you to make a Discernment+Survival check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards. Your Cognition+Survival check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles. You also use Survival to make Primal Evocation attack rolls.

**Thievery**
: Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Agility+Thievery check. The GM might also call for a Agility+Thievery check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.
