      <description>How in the world do feats work here? What is there to upgrade?
Should there be more differentiation between base and upgraded block, dodge, and parry?
Crits/doubles/failure/miss/other triggers
Weaken?
 Strike As an action, make a melee attack against a target you engage (rolling MIGHT vs AC, dealing WEAPON + MIGHT damage on a hit, and MIGHT damage on a miss). Shot As an action, make a ranged attack against a target in your weapon range (rolling AGILITY vs AC, and dealing WPN damage on a hit).</description>

      <description>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric&amp;mdash;performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service.</description>

      <description>TODO:  Any martial variants? +Level to spell damage rolls? Domain like fighter subclass at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16? Or 1 bonus per tier at 1, 6, 11, 16? Does it grant extra prayers? Extra Bond? Some of the domains make sense to grant non-divine prayers but what about ones that mostly/only give divine prayers? Do prayers have &amp;ldquo;levels&amp;rdquo; or just tiers?     Deities work their will upon the world in infinite ways, and you serve as one of their most stalwart mortal servants.</description>

      <description>TODO:  +Level to weapon damage rolls? (+half Level to weapon damage rolls) HP includes Vitality modifier per Level? Or Vitality score per Tier? Or Vitality modifier per Tier? Gunslinger is fighter subclass? Are there subclasses? Subclass is instead of exploits at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16? Or is subclass extra an unnecessary complexity? I like the idea of picking at least one continuous thematic thing and it enables out-of-class features.</description>

      <description>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These primal adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the influence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</description>

      <description>Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible&amp;mdash;such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals.</description>
